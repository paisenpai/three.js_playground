# Three.js Playground

A simple playground website for experimenting with **Three.js**, a 3D JavaScript library

Test out shapes, lighting, materials, textures, and other features. 

This project is ideal for learning the basics of 3D rendering and gaining hands-on experience with Three.js.

## Features

- **Shapes**: Create and manipulate 3D shapes (e.g., cubes, spheres, cones).
- **Lighting**: Experiment with different light types (e.g., ambient, point, spotlights).
- **Materials and Textures**: Test various materials (e.g., standard, phong, basic).
- **Dynamic Updates**: Adjust parameters in real time using a GUI panel.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/three.js_playground.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd three.js_playground
   ```
3. Install parcel:
   ```bash
   npm install parcel -g
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Run Parcel by typing this command:
   ```bash
   npx parcel ./src/index.html
   ```
6. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:1234
   ```

## Usage

- **Add Shapes**: Click on the GUI options to add and modify 3D shapes.
- **Change Lighting**: Toggle and adjust light sources to see how they affect the scene.
- **Add Textures**: Toggle and add your own textures to the background and on individual shapes.
- **Simple Animations**: Shapes are animated with simple movements, do as you will.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: For creating and rendering 3D objects.
- **dat.GUI**: For a user-friendly graphical interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language.

## Roadmap

- Add physics simulations
- Enable exporting and importing of 3D models.
